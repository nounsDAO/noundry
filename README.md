# Noundry

Welcome to the Noundry, a community-sourced Noun trait workshop.

![thenouning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85371573/153062899-2b3ce450-197c-4c45-8856-859553c72527.jpg)

Submit trait artwork now for potential inclusion in the Nouns protocol!

## Introduction

The [Nouns protocol](https://nouns.notion.site/Noun-Protocol-32e4f0bf74fe433e927e2ea35e52a507) code and artwork are upgradeable and extensible, both of which are controlled by the Nouns DAO.

Noun artwork, called traits, can be voted into the protocol via a [Nouns DAO proposal](https://nouns.notion.site/Submit-a-Proposal-to-the-DAO-0605e2437e184eae82dc07c30bcd2ed9). This repository exists as a centralized storage solution for potential Noun traits.

**Acceptance into this repository does not equate to acceptance into the protocol.**

## Contributing Traits

### 1. Fork this repository
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

- GitHub Codespaces:
  - [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and run the project locally.

### 2. Commit your artwork
- Noun traits must be submitted as 32x32 pixel PNG images. Each image must contain a single trait, which is placed in the correct [trait](./traits) sub-folder. The following trait types are accepted, with the first being the lowest layer: `bodies`, `accessories`, `heads`, `glasses`. A trait which precedes your custom trait may paint over some or all of it.
- Ensure Noun trait files are named appropriately. For example, a file containing a boat head should be called `boat.png`.
- By contributing to this repository, you release all committed artwork under a Creative Commons license; waiving all copyright and related rights to the artwork. Read the contributor license agreement [here](./CLA.md).
- Keep it _nounish_. Artwork that is explicit, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate will not be accepted.
- Only the initial contributor, or a user with the consent of the initial contributor, can replace exising artwork. Otherwise, artwork should be added as a separate image.

### 3. Create a Pull Request
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill in the pull request description, which summarizes the traits being added.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
